# Data 

## Aquatic invertebrates
- `Benthic_vegetation_QCC.csv` aquatic invertebrate file, occurrences of 1 or fewer removed <- input for both scripts
- `Benthic_invertebrates_univariate.csv` - univariate variables generated by "benthic_univariate.R" script
- `benthic_inverts_relativized.csv` - using decostand, divide by column max
- `NMDS_benthic_inverts_scores.csv` - NMDS ordination scores
- `NMDS_benthic_vectors_axis12.csv` - vectors associated with axis 1 and 2 of NMDS (r > 0.2)
- `NMDS_benthic_vectors_axis13.csv` - vectors associated with axis 1 and 3 of NMDS (r > 0.2)
- `benthic_inverts_relativized_clusters.csv` - relativized matrix with cluster groups 3 and 4
- `benthic_cluster_NMDS_scores` - NMDS scores with clusters
- `benthic_ISA_threegroups.csv` - Indicator species (IS) from three groups
- `benthic_ISA_fourgroups.csv` - Indicator species from four groups
- `NMDS_benth_cluster_vector12.csv` - IS vectors (p value < 0.05) for axis 1 and 2
- `NMDS_benth_cluster_vector13.csv` - IS vectors (p value < 0.05) for axis 1 and 3





## Emerging invertebrates


### Congruence

- `benthic_rares_rel.csv`  - vegetation samples from QCC with rares (<= 2) removed and rel. by column max
- `inverts_rel_rares_2018.csv` - emerging inverts from only 2018 to test congruence
