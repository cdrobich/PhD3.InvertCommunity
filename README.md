## Invertebrate communities


Comparing the invertebrate communities among invaded (Phragmites), uninvaded (cattail, meadow) and herbicide-treated (restore) sites in Long Point. There were 9 sites in each vegetation type and they spanned a water depth gradient. Were collected in two years, 2017 and 2018, over the field season (4 collections in 2017, 6 in 2018). Will combine them since differences between years are not of interest. 

### Analyses

# Juvenille aquatic invertebrates

1. Univariate analyses
    - one-way ANOVAs with habitat type for abundance and richness
    - did a GLMM of these too (for no good reason)
    - made violin plots for abundance, richness, Simpsons, Shannon-Weiner, and Pielou's
    
2. Mulivariate analyses
    - one-way perMANOVA with pairwise comparison
    - NMDS to visualize the groups
    
# Emerging adult invertebrates

1. Univariate
    - two-way ANOVAs with habitat and year for abundance and richness
    - used a GLMM and treated year and number of collections as a random effect; compared to a null
    - NMDS to visualize 
    - Did hierarchical clustering of 2 - 10 groups then used Indicator Species Analysis to choose 3 groups as optimal (in PC-ORD)
    - Made an NMDS figure to visualize the groups
